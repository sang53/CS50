Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The teams that did not win any tournaments at lower iterations were incorrect (0 -> 0.5%)
The middle teams who won few tournaments at lower iterations had large variances
    - randomly winning a few extra tournaments would lead to large jumps in percentage
The top teams generally did not change much (20% -> 21.2%) as even at lowerish (>10) iterations as they have a large winning sample size

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

For this prediction, 10000 simulations would probably be 'good enough'.
Generally, it would depend on the desired precision of results
    - if interested in 0.1% you would need to run at least 1,000 simulations
Another factor would be if you need a value for every/specific outcomes
    - japan & russia have <0.0% chance so you would need at least 10,000 simulations

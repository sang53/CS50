If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

MIN(energy) = 0.296     MIN(danceability) = 0.258   MIN(valence) = 0.080
AVG(energy) = 0.659     AVG(danceability) = 0.716   AVG(valence) = 0.484
MAX(energy) = 0.909     MAX(danceability) = 0.964   MAX(valence) = 0.931

- Listens to songs that are popular in a variety of genres & moods
- If taking averages, their audio aura is dancing songs of moderate energy and valence.
- Overall, listens to songs that have more energy & danceability.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
- This list is only the listener's top 100 songs
- There is no data of how many times these songs were played
- Only using min/max & average does not take into account the distribution/variance

What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
- Create song categories according to energy, valence, danceability (+ other qualities)
- Assign "aura/s" to song categories, perhaps with some sort of weighting
- Use this data to find the overall "aura" of the listener for the year
